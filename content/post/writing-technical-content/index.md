Data sharing poses a significant hurdle for large-scale machine learning in numerous industries. It is a natural goal to study the advanced quantum computing ecosystem, which will be comprised of heterogeneous federated resources. In this work, the problem of data governance and privacy is handled by developing a quantum federated learning approach, that can be efficiently executed on quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We present the federated hybrid quantumâ€“classical algorithm called a quanvolutional neural network with distributed training on different sites without exchanging data.
