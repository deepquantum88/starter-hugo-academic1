abstract: "During the last three decades, quantum neural computation has received a relatively high amount of attention among researchers and academic communities since the model of quantum neural network has been proposed. Matrix product state is the well-designed class of tensor network states, which plays an important role in processing of quantum information. The area of dynamical systems help us to study the temporal behavior of systems in time. In our previous work, we have shown the relationship between quantum finite state machine and matrix product state. In this paper, we have used the proposed unitary criteria to investigate the dynamics of matrix product state with quantum weightless neural networks, where the output qubit is extracted and fed back (iterated) to input. Further, we have used Von Neumann entropy to measure possible entanglement of output quantum state. Finally, we have plotted the dynamics for each matrix product state against iterations and analyzed their results."
