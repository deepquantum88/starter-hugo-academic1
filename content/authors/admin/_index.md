I earned my Ph.D. in Quantum Computation and Information at the Department of Computer Science, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India in 2020. After my Ph.D., during the pandemic, I worked as a Postdoctoral fellow in Prof Daniel Braun Group at the University of Tubingen, Germany. I’m currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University under Prof. Alam’s group and the Department of Chemistry under Prof. Kais group.

I am greatly interested in quantum technologies, education, and public outreach activities. I previously worked on quantum computational models and their applications in Biology, Chemistry, and tensor network theory. Now I’m focused on quantum optimization using resilient algorithms in the financial sector. I am currently working on near-term quantum computing techniques, particularly variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning algorithms with applications in engineering disciplines and more recently, in the Photovoltaic (PV) power systems, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors.

My research interests lie in the fields of Quantum Computation, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum/classical Machine Learning, Medical imaging, Cheminformatics, Tensor network theory, Theory of Computation, and Formal Languages. Skilled in programming languages with experience using quantum computing frameworks such as Qiskit, Cirq, and Pennylane.
