abstract: In recent years, the concept of federated machine learning has been actively driven by scientists to ease the privacy concerns of data owners. Currently, the combination of machine learning and quantum computing technologies is a hot industry topic and is positioned to be a major disruptor. It has become an effective new tool for reshaping several industries ranging from healthcare to finance. Data sharing poses a significant hurdle for large-scale machine learning in numerous industries. It is a natural goal to study the advanced quantum computing ecosystem, which will be comprised of heterogeneous federated resources. In this work, the problem of data governance and privacy is handled by developing a quantum federated learning approach, that can be efficiently executed on quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We present the federated hybrid quantum–classical algorithm called a quanvolutional neural network with distributed training on different sites without exchanging data. The hybrid algorithm requires small quantum circuits to produce meaningful features for image classification tasks, which makes it ideal for near-term quantum computing. The primary goal of this work is to evaluate the potential benefits of hybrid quantum–classical and classical-quantum convolutional neural networks on non-independently and non-identically partitioned (Non-IID) and real-world data partitioned datasets among several healthcare institutions/clients. We investigated the performance of a collaborative quanvolutional neural network on two medical machine learning datasets, COVID-19 and MedNIST. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed quantum federated learning framework. Our findings demonstrate a decrease of 2%–39% times in necessary communication rounds compared to the federated stochastic gradient descent approach. The hybrid federated framework maintained a high classification testing accuracy and generalizability, even in scenarios where the medical data is unevenly distributed among clients.
