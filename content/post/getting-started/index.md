title: A cover art assosciated with "Quantum Machine Learning Predicting ADME-Tox Properties" has been accepted as Front Cover in ACS Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling.
subtitle: In the drug discovery paradigm, the evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicity properties of new chemical entities is one of the most critical issues, which is a time-consuming process, immensely expensive, and poses formidable challenges in pharmaceutical R&D. Currently, the blend of quantum computation and machine learning has attracted considerable attention in almost every field ranging from chemistry to biomedicine and several engineering disciplines as well. Quantum computers have the potential to bring advances in high-throughput experimental techniques and in screening billions of molecules by reducing development costs and time associated with the drug discovery process.
