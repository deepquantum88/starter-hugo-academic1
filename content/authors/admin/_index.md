I earned my Ph.D. in Quantum Computation and Information at the Department of Computer Science, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, India in 2020. After my Ph.D., during the pandemic, I worked as a Postdoctoral fellow in Prof Daniel Braun Group at the University of Tubingen, Germany. I’m currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University under Prof. Alam’s group and the Department of Chemistry under Prof. Kais group.

I have a deep interest in quantum technologies, with a particular focus on education and public outreach. My previous work has involved quantum computational models and their applications in Biology, Chemistry, and Tensor Network Theory. Currently, I am concentrating on quantum optimization using resilient algorithms within the financial sector. My research is centered on near-term quantum computing techniques, specifically variational quantum algorithms and quantum/classical machine learning. I am exploring their applications across various engineering disciplines, and more recently, in healthcare, manufacturing, and finance. Currently, I am working on privacy-preserving quantum federated learning algorithms for heterogeneous data, further advancing the intersection of quantum computing and data privacy in healthcare sector.
