abstract: "In recent years, the modeling interest has increased significantly from molecular level to
atomic and quantum levels. Computational chemistry plays a significant role in designing
computational models for the operation and simulation of systems ranging from atoms and
molecules to industrial processes. It is influenced by a tremendous increase in computing
power and the efficiency of algorithms. The representation of chemical reactions using
classical automata theory in thermodynamic terms had a great influence on computer
science. The study of chemical information processing with quantum computational
models is a natural goal. In this study, we have modeled chemical reactions using
two-way quantum finite automata, which are halted in linear time. Additionally, classical
pushdown automata can be designed for such chemical reactions with multiple stacks. It
has been proven that computational versatility can be increased by combining chemical
accept/reject signatures and quantum automata models."
