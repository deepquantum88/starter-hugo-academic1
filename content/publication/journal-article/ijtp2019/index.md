abstract: "Inspired by the results of finite automata working on infinite words, we studied the quantum ω-automata with Büchi, Muller, Rabin and Streett acceptance condition. Quantum finite automata play a pivotal part in quantum information and computational theory. Investigation of the power of quantum finite automata over infinite words is a natural goal. We have investigated the classes of quantum ω-automata from two aspects: the language recognition and their closure properties. It has been shown that quantum Muller automaton is more dominant than quantum Büchi automaton. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the languages recognized by one-way quantum finite automata with different quantum acceptance conditions. Finally, we have proved the closure properties of quantum ω-automata."
