title: On the Robustness of Variational Quantum Classifier against Label Flipping Attacks in Federated Learning for Semiconductor Manufacturing
subtitle: Due to the widespread presence of manufacturing units, real-time data collection becomes a challenging task, especially as the scale of operations continues to expand. Moreover, manufacturing industries often deal with sensitive and proprietary data and are reluctant to share data directly in areas like lithography hotspot detection (LHD) due to concerns about IP protection and regulatory compliance.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: In this work, we proposed a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) framework for lithography hotspot detection and offer a unique solution to address the challenges mentioned above effectively. To demonstrate the generalization ability and robustness, we performed extensive experiments with label-flipping attacks in the proposed framework.
